# Example 2: Beaufort Scale (very common in marine operations)
beaufort_calm,45.0,8.5,0,beaufort,0.0,0.2,0.001,drone,"Beaufort 0 - Calm (< 1 knot)"
beaufort_light_air,45.0,8.5,1,beaufort,0.0,0.3,0.001,drone,"Beaufort 1 - Light air (1-3 knots)"
beaufort_light_breeze,45.0,8.5,2,beaufort,0.0,0.4,0.001,drone,"Beaufort 2 - Light breeze (4-6 knots)"
beaufort_gentle_breeze,45.0,8.5,3,beaufort,0.0,0.6,0.001,drone,"Beaufort 3 - Gentle breeze (7-10 knots)"
beaufort_moderate_breeze,45.0,8.5,4,beaufort,0.0,0.8,0.002,drone,"Beaufort 4 - Moderate breeze (11-16 knots)"
beaufort_fresh_breeze,45.0,8.5,5,beaufort,0.0,1.2,0.002,drone,"Beaufort 5 - Fresh breeze (17-21 knots)"
beaufort_strong_breeze,45.0,8.5,6,beaufort,2.0,1.8,0.002,drone,"Beaufort 6 - Strong breeze (22-27 knots)"
beaufort_near_gale,45.0,8.5,7,beaufort,5.0,2.5,0.003,drone,"Beaufort 7 - Near gale (28-33 knots)"
beaufort_gale,45.0,8.5,8,beaufort,8.0,3.2,0.005,drone,"Beaufort 8 - Gale (34-40 knots)"

# Example 3: Real weather station data scenarios
# Note: Many weather stations report in different units
weather_station_marine,60.0,12.3,15.5,knots,0.0,0.8,0.0008,nvg,"Typical marine weather station output"
weather_station_land,30.0,15.2,12.4,mph,1.2,0.0,0.01,human,"Land-based weather station (mph common in US)"
weather_station_international,90.0,6.8,22.3,km/h,0.0,1.5,0.0003,drone,"International weather station (km/h common)"

# Example 4: Extreme conditions
hurricane_force,120.0,18.5,12,beaufort,45.0,8.5,0.02,drone,"Hurricane force winds - Beaufort 12"
storm_conditions,180.0,10.2,65.0,knots,25.0,6.2,0.015,drone,"Severe storm - wind in knots"

# Example 5: Mixed unit scenarios (what you might get from different data sources)
